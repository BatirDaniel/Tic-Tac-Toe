# Tic-Tac-Toe
TicTacToe is a mobile application developed in Java using the Android Studio platform. At the current stage of development, the application includes two game modes, Singleplayer and Multiplayer.

The application interface is designed to be easy to use and pleasant for users. In Singleplayer mode, the player will face an AI opponent, who will use different strategies depending on the chosen difficulty level. The player can choose to play on easy, medium or hard level.
In Multiplayer mode, two players can play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other on the same device.
